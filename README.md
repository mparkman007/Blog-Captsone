# Blog-Captsone
This was a capstone for the APPbrewery Fullstack bootcamp udemy course that required us to make a blog-like website to show case our understanding of Javascript, Express, EJS, Node, and Middleware.

I created a blog site that would in theory allow for anonymous posts to be submitted and viewed by all. This being a very early build, something I mihgt continue on later,
it only keeps posts that are in your current browser memory as it is not tied to a database just yet. This project was to show case the ability to take in data and access it as well as transfer it
to any related page and do something with that data. CUrrently you can create a new post, view older posts, edit older posts with a button toggle, and delete posts.

I enjoyed the css themeing from one of our previous exercises and borrowed from it, and I plan on returning to this project at some point to overhaul it down the road. I hope you enjoy!
